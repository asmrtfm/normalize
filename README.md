# normalize
for the improvement of code readability and developer sanity

### This script:
 - takes a single argument as its input: a file
 - intelligently converts spaces to tabs for indentation
 - normalizes usage of commas
 - can be ran manually or setup as a git hook (for example, .git/commit-hook)
 - was designed to normalize javascript, but should be just as useful for any language that allows tabs for indentation.

## TODO
[ ] add commandline options for selecting various combinations of normalization actions.
